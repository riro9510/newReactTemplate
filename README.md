## 🧼 Lint & Format

---

1. Manual (long version)

npm run lint:fix && npm run format

2. The shortcut you deserve

tidy

3. Forgot to tidy up?

I got your back, boss — it runs automatically on commit 😎
(lens drop moment)

## 💬 Standardized Commits

Tired of messy commit messages? Or maybe you're still seeing things like fix stuff or yo arreglé eso que rompí jeje in your team history?

Let’s commit like PROs. 💼😎

This template comes with Commitizen + Husky + lint-staged all set up to guide you (or your team) to write beautiful, consistent commit messages.

It uses a custom format like:

const msg = `${answers.date} ${answers.version} ${answers.type}: ${answers.description} Jira/Trello: ${answers.jira} ReadyToRelease: ${answers.ready}`;

That means your commits will look like:

2025-04-14 v1.2.3 feat: Add login form component Jira: ABC-123 ReadyToRelease: ✅

Want to go even further? You could automate the ReadyToRelease field based on your test results.
This is just a base, go ahead and make it yours.

## 🕳️ Bypassing the rules

Need to make a quick commit and skip the checks (we won’t judge 👀)?
Use the --no-verify flag:

git commit -m "hotfix: emergency fix" --no-verify

```bash

```
